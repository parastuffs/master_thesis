\chapter{Technical background}

This chapter will address the technical ground inherent to this work: first the operating system, followed by the cryptography and networking.

\section{Network and VPN implementation}

% Present the TCP/IP layering

% First explain what a VPN is.

There exist several major implementations of VPN: SSL, IPSec and PPTP.
The later was developped by a vendor consortium and proposed in the RFC 2637 and will not be discussed further.

\subsection{SSL/TLS}
% Introduce SSL/TLS, talk about the protocol, the key exchange and stuff, but leaver OpenVPN for the 'implementation' chapter.
% Question the security? Apparently, it does mac-then-encrypt, which is insecure regarding certain types of attacks \cite{cryptoeprint:2001:045}.
% Plus, SSLv3 is to be deprecated, according to a queued RFC: http://www.rfc-editor.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tls-sslv3-diediedie-03.txt

\subsection{IPSec}
% IPSec as a protocol, strongswan come in the 'implementation' chapter.
