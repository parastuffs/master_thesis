% Here, I could show the gcm256, which show better performances with the BA411e, but I would be weird to compare it with aes256cbc.
% I need another graph with a CPu usage comparison to show that even if the perf are the same for soft/hard with aes256gcm, the hard loads less the CPU (I hope so, at least).
